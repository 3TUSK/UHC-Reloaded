# UltraHardcore: Reload
This is a Minecraft mod with the purpose to make UltraHardcore-Mode Forge-compatible in 1.8

The idea of this mod has various origin, e.g.:

http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/ultrahardcore/
http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1281162-1-4-5-xxxhardcorexxx-mod

Although there is cauldron, a Forge version still seems necessary.

#About the mod itself
As the author, I have to say I am an amateur, so there is still a long way for me to go.

I am willing to accept suggestions and bug-reports which are helpful for this mod.

(Actually I dont know what I should say here)
