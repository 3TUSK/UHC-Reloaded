# UltraHardcore: Reload
This is a Minecraft mod with the purpose to make UltraHardcore-Mode Forge-compatible in 1.8

Basically, this mod is trying following UHC rules from here: http://www.reddit.com/r/ultrahardcore/wiki/playerfaq

The idea of this mod has various origin, including but not limited in:

http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/ultrahardcore/

http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/ultra-hardcore/

http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1281162-1-4-5-xxxhardcorexxx-mod

(Currently it is an unfinished list.)

Although there is cauldron, a Forge version still seems necessary.

#About the mod itself
As the author, I have to say I am an amateur, so there is still a long way for me to go.

While I was coding, I might use other's code as reference. 
I tried to give credit which I think as necessary, but there may be some missing. If there is missing, please remind me.

I am willing to accept suggestions and bug-reports which are helpful for this mod.

(Actually I don't know what I should say here)
