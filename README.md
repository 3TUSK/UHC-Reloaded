The idea of this mod has various origin, including but not limited in:

(Currently it is an unfinished list.)

Although there is cauldron, a Forge version still seems necessary.

#About the mod itself
As the author, I have to say I am an amateur, so there is still a long way for me to go.

While I was coding, I might use other's code as reference. 
I tried to give credit which I think as necessary, but there may be some missing. If there is missing, please remind me.

I am willing to accept suggestions and bug-reports which are helpful for this mod.

(Actually I dont know what I should say here)
